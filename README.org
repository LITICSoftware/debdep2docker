=debdep2docker=

A tool to create a =Dockerfile= for the dependencies of Debian packages, given
as =.deb= files.

This is useful if you build Debian packages for software that you develop, and
which depends on some official Debian packages. You can build an image
containing only your software (updated frequently) while depending on a (cached)
image that contains all dependencies.
